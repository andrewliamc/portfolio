# portfolio
the repo for my developer portfolio

This is the first project that I have started as a self-taught developer who has be learning development for about a month. 

The technologies that I will be using are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I will also be designing the portfolio as well, as I have experience with graphic design / web design.
